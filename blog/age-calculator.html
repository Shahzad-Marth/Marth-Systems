            <h2 id="what-is">What is an Online Age Calculator?</h2>
            <p>An age calculator is a simple digital tool: enter your date of birth and instantly get your exact age in
                <strong>years, months, and days</strong>. It removes manual calculation errors and returns precise
                results in seconds.</p>

            <h2 id="everyday-uses">Everyday Uses of an Age Calculator</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Official documents and forms:</strong> Job applications, passports, or government forms
                    often require exact age—this tool gives it instantly.</li>
                <li><strong>School and college registrations:</strong> Parents can confirm eligibility quickly when
                    admission criteria depend on exact age.</li>
                <li><strong>Sports and competitions:</strong> Many events enforce strict age categories (e.g., U-18).
                    Use the calculator to verify eligibility before signing up.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal & retirement planning:</strong> Certain legal milestones and benefit eligibilities use
                    exact age in years and months.</li>
                <li><strong>For fun:</strong> Curious how many days old you are? The exact-day count can be surprisingly
                    interesting.</li>
            </ul>
